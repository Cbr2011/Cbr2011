Since I'm now running out of ideas. Summit a pull request of your idea in <a href="https://github.com/Cbr-s-Coding-Playground/Cbr-s-Coding-Playground.github.io" target="_blank">Cbr's Coding Playground GitHub Page</a> (read the `README.md` first please!) and see if it gets mergered! if it doesn't. Just know there's other things you can summit a pull request on
